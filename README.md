In this repository, a novel method for neural networks interpretability is introduced. In this method, a second smaller network is trained such that it can find the corresponding score for each feature. 
Below are some results for a fully-connected newtoek trained on MNIST dataset. On the left is the original input and on the right is the heat map generated by the model
